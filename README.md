# accounts_creation_rpa-revamp 
The project was initially intended to be an update of [accounts_creation_rpa-initial](https://github.com/ilia19945/accounts_creation_rpa-initial).
I decided to create another repo instead due to not being able to properly finish revamping.  

This is just a little example of how the revamp is supposed to look like.  
This particular code was optimized from horrible **45 rows** [here](https://github.com/ilia19945/accounts_creation_rpa-initial/blob/ff799f2b70c0bc9f9febdab9dd024911a7f6b06c/mainfastapi.py#L58-L102) -> to just **10 rows** with a use of use of Pydantic validation.
